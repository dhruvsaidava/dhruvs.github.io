                  how will it be evaluated? <br>
                  projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery <br>

                     <strong>What will it do? </strong><br>
                     Makerbot  will help student to understand different making and prototyping experience. <br> 
                     Student particularly work on science projects making models and stuff which explain the concept of the project and working behind it they are in need of some automation which they want to add. <br>
                     But as soon they see arduino with lot of wires and connection they lose their confidence and feel that it's hard.  <br>
                     Makerbot will help them to learn Microcontroller , coding and Robotics which can help them to make stuffs.<br>
                     By help of this they will easily learn and work on engineering science and different magnetism concepts.<br>
                     <br>
                     <strong>who's done what beforehand?</strong>
                     Many different boards and design where available by students make something with it there are not that easy so student find its learning easy and good for prototyping so my try was to make something which is very easy for them and cost . <br>
                     <br>
                     Products like <br>
                     Pi-Bot: The Ultimate Robotics Education Experience <br>
                     <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1158090852/pi-bot-the-next-great-tool-in-robotics-learning-pl"> Link to Pi-Bot</a>  Its Kickstarter Project <br>
                     My idea was to simplify this project to some extent in which training to students would be easy and they like to to work on it. <br>
                     <br> <strong>what materials and components will be required?</strong> <br>
                     It requires electronics with few sensors and LED on it it will be a combination of a Boat which includes all component.<br>
                     list of component in a  bot.
                  <ul>
                     <li>LED</li>
                     <li>battery 12 volt dc rechargeable</li>
                     <li>Potentiometer</li>
                     <li>ultrasonic sensor</li>
                     <li>LDR    </li>
                     <li>Bluetooth</li>
                     <li>satshakit board</li>
                     <li> 360 Servo Motors</li>
                     <li>Wheels ( 3D Printed )</li>
                     <li>Castor</li>
                     <li>Circuit board</li>
                     <li>LCD Display I2C</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>Where will they come from?</strong><br>
                  Materials are generally resources from Amazon and local electronics market I can get that easily as this is like it which is to be which is to be modified for them.<br>
                  <strong>How much will it cost?</strong><br>
                  Total cost of the project would not exceed from 70$ which is 2000 Indian rupee.<br>
                  Its Cost of single board would be near 30$ but with whole kit like motors it will be more.
                  <br>      
                  <strong> what parts and systems will be made?</strong><br>
                  Circuit Board milling and slodering t<br>
                  Connecters<br>
                  3D Printed Wheels<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>what processes will be used?</strong><br>
                  For making this day I like it a lot of different different processes is used to get the final get ready. <br>
                  <ul>
                     <li>laser cutting</li>
                     <li>CNC</li>
                     <li>circuit designing</li>
                     <li>embedded programming</li>
                     <li>CAD</li>
                     <li>3D printing</li>
                  </ul>
                  what tasks need to be completed? <br>
                  Its need to add more sensors when design for commercial Purpose. Double side PCB design is required.
                  what questions need to be answered? <br>
                  how will it be evaluated? <br>
                  projects can be separate or joint, but need to show individual mastery <br>
                  of the range of skills covered <br>
                  where possible, you should make rather than buy the parts of your project <br>
