                     all done. <br>
                     Task remain is in documentation part like Creating DIY Cards and making production based design for students.<br> <br>
                     <strong>What has worked? what hasn't?</strong><br>
                     Sensor , LCD , Design , worked well without error. <br>
                     Bluettoh HC-05 was not working perfectly. <br> 
                     It take one command of forward then don't recive next command again till it not disconnected and reconnect it again.<br><br>
                     <strong>what questions need to be resolved?</strong><br>

                     Working on Error solving in Bluetooth based controlling, trying to find error for bluetooth communication. 
                     <strong>what have you learned?</strong><br>
                     <br>
                     I am Civil Engineer, this all fabrication was new to me and I got to know how its working. Due to hectic time schedule during course it was not able to go that deep to learn properly but I found more capable when I started teaching same so this learning helped me learn fabrication in best way insuch 6 month short time. <br> 
                     <br>
                     <strong>Documentation during development</strong> <br>
                     I found my self as not that good in documentation , and I require more time to document it properly. Later on I started with documeting in notebook and code it on raw HTML.<br>
                     I later realized about it. when time was very less. <br>
