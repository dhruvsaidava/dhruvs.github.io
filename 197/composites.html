                        <li>
                          In this assignment we have used laser cutting sheet which combine  and create a structure to support and act as form work.</li>
                      <li>Laser cutting the scaled version of table. Its Circular based ring which connects step wise to vertical support to form a structure.</li>
                      <li>Design is created using Rhino Software in 2D</li>
                      <li>After that it is laser cut and those part are assemble</li>
                      <li>Thin Plastic layer which will act as support ( Formwork ) for Composite</li>
                      <li>Use gloves for protection</li>
                      <li> <strong>Using Resin :</strong>Take equal quantities(by volume) of resin and hardener of Adralite Standard. Mix the resin and hardner until it forms a uniform colour. Apply a thin coat of the mixture on both the surfaces. Join the surfaces and apply pressure using tape, clamps or band. Remove the pressure after 6 -8 hours. Full strength is achieved in 24 hours</li>
                      <li>Applying Resing ( Araldite Standard Epoxy Adhesive ) properly all side in thin layer</li>
                      <li>Covering it with Natural fiber sheet , here Jute Fiber sheet is used</li>
                      <li>Press fiber proper with lees force so it get properly layered with surface</li>
                      <li>After that apply one more layer of epoxy resin</li>
                      <li>Put whole assembly in vaccum bag for vacum process.</li>
                      <li>lock Vaccum bag properly so any air input should not happen while doing vaccum</li>
                      <li>Now turn on vaccum to get proper suction inside bag</li>
                      <li>Remove bag after composite get hard enough</li>

<br>
<br>
<Strong>CHARACTERISTICS</Strong><br>
Colourless to light brown, syrupy liquid. <br>
<strong>INCOMPATIBILITY</strong><br>
Keep away from heat and sources of ignition. Araldite resin materials are reactive and some are highly inflammable.
<strong>HEALTH HAZARD DATA</strong><br>
These resins may cause irritation or sensitisation to the skin and eyes and may be toxic if ingested. <br>
<strong>HANDLING and GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</strong> <br>
Use a fume hood. <br>
Avoid skin and eye contact. <br>
Avoid inhalation or ingestion of the powder. <br>
Keep away from heat or naked flames. <br>
Keep away from moisture. <br>
Keep the container tightly sealed. <br>
Wash hands thoroughly after handling. <br>
Use a fume hood to minimise exposure to this substance. Wear protective clothing. A long sleeved laboratory coat or gown, PVC or neoprene rubber gloves, safety goggles and a face mask as a minimum standard. <br>
<strong>TREATMENTS</strong> <br>
Skin ­ immediately remove contaminated clothing and wash the affected area with soap or mild detergent and large amounts of water until all evidence of the chemical has been removed (approximately 15 minutes). Any material adhering to the skin should be removed with resin­removing cream*; solvents should not be used. If hypersensitivity develops seek medical attention. <br>
Eyes ­ immediately wash the affected eye with large amounts of water until all evidence of the chemical has been removed (approximately 15 minutes). If irritation or pain persist seek immediate medical attention.
Inhalation ­ remove from the area of exposure to fresh air. If breathing has ceased apply artificial respiration. Keep warm and allow to rest. If irritation persists or signs of toxicity develop seek medical attention.
Ingestion ­ wash out the mouth thoroughly with water and give water to drink. Do not induce vomiting. Induce vomiting by touching a finger to the back of the throat. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. Seek immediate medical advice. <br>
<strong>STORAGE</strong><br>
Store in a cool, dry atmosphere away from heat or ignition sources. <br>
<strong>DISPOSAL</strong>
Uncured epoxy waste must be disposed of by waste disposal contractor. Cured waste may be removed by normal disposal methods. <br>

                         Connecting them it will come up to this shape which is the basic shape of the design.</center>

                         <center><img src="images/week14/covering.jpg" alt="" width="600"><br> After that it is covered with thin plastic which act as support to natural fiber while applying resinand shape according to it. <br><br>

                         Now it need to cover with layer of thin plactic which act as supporting to composite shape.<br><br><br>




                        
                        <img src="images/week14/applying composite.jpg" alt="" width="600"><br> <br><br>

                        Applying Araldite based one layer  with brush.<br><br><br>

                       Now adding a sheet of natural fiber Jute on it. 
                        
                        <img src="images/week14/reapplyinglayer.jpg" alt="" width="600"><br> <br>
                        Now apply layer again jute sheet should be proper covered with it.
                        <img src="images/week14/sealing vacuum bag.jpg" alt="" width="600"><br> <br>
                        After layer  is properly coverd its need to compress it and remove voids from it.
                        This can be done by creating vacuum . So puting it to bag and  Seal it completely. <br>
                        
                        <img src="images/week14/vacuum compress.jpg" alt="" width="600"><br> <br>

                        After Vacuum keep it so it get that hard.

                        After hardening it will get shape according to it.
