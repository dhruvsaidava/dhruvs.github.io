                     Robot is always a quick connecting to students in schools. They always want to build something like that and learn how it works.
                     <br>
                     Bot is a small BO motor based 2/4 wheeler bot which has a Circuit connected with micro controller. This Board has different input output systems which makes  Learning Coding with micro controllers and playing with few robotics concepts easier.

                     <strong>what tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain? </strong><br> <br>
                     Circuit Board making , Programming , 3D Design , Laser Cutting, Supports  <br>  
                     all done. <br>
                     Task remain is in documentation part like Creating DIY Cards and making production based design for students.<br> <br>
                     <strong>What has worked? what hasn't?</strong><br>
                     Sensor , LCD , Design , worked well without error. <br>
                     Bluetooth HC-05 was not working perfectly. <br> 
                     It take one command of forward then don't receive next command again till it not disconnected and reconnect it again.<br><br>
                     <strong>what questions need to be resolved?</strong><br>
                     Adding more mounted Sensor option for students to prototype. <br><br>
                     <strong> What will happen when?</strong><br> <br>
                     Working on Error solving in Bluetooth based controlling, trying to find error for bluetooth communication. 
                     <br><br><strong>what have you learned?</strong><br>
                     <br>
                     I am Civil Engineer, this all fabrication was new to me and I got to know how its working. Due to hectic time schedule during course it was not able to go that deep to learn properly but I found more capable when I started teaching same so this learning helped me learn fabrication in best way in such 6 month short time. <br> 
                     <br>
                     <strong>Documentation during development</strong> <br>
                     I found my self as not that good in documentation , and I require more time to document it properly. Later on I started with documenting in notebook and code it on raw HTML.<br>
                     I later realized about it. when time was very less. <br>

                  <br>
                  <p>It will be double layered PCB with different components having proper power options and series of led of each pin.
                     This will help them to have hazzle free coding and reduce short circuit as in jumper wire it happens lots time. <br> <br>Main thing is this Board can be converted to Robot also which student really like to make and experiment.
                  </p>
                  <b>Doing to use PCB board as base </b> on which we can add BO Motors by adding 4 Clamps and raster. so DIY Board get converted into bot.

                        LEDs are on board so that can be directly use to check outputs of that pin are working perfectly or not. This will also help in practicing with programing.

                        Potentiometer can be used as input in analog as well as Digital. Many Projects can be done for teaching input programing to kids.

                     <li><strong>GAS Sensor</strong><br>
                        MQ-3 Gas Sensor is used for detection of alcohol. It help in detection. students can understand Gas detection system and do project on it. <br>
                        Different Gas Sensor are available in MQ Series which can be used in different gases detection.

                  <h5>I've implemented this code to control Servo motors of the Chotu bot, taking input from Bluetooth HC05. I've used this <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.giumig.apps.bluetoothserialmonitor">Android Application</a> which is used to send control inputs to the bot. The main problem faced here was the to change instructions of servo moment as fast as possible. Since servo instructions are kind of non-preemption, it won't take immediate action until last instruction completes its execution. This inconsistency also breaks bluetooth communication channel of bot - mobile and it continues to repeat last instruction after taking one or two rapid inputs from the mobile.</h5>
